            <p>
              Hi there! I'm Zoe, a passionate software developer with a unique
              background in clinical support and data science, blending
              technical expertise with problem-solving skills to build
              innovative and functional applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              With 3 years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize
              in ReactJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS, creating scalable
              solutions that enhance data integrity and user experience and
              especially enjoy creating user-friendly solutions that solve
              real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey into tech started with a passion for data and its
              potential to drive meaningful insights. Over time, I transitioned
              into software development, where I now focus on building
              intuitive, high-performance applications. I love working with
              modern technologies and constantly strive to learn new tools and
              methodologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking,
              bouldering, or out playing tennis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact,
              and I'm always looking for new challenges that push me to grow as
              a developer which is why I'm doing the 12 projects in 12 months of
              2025!.
